# Daily Wallpaper Delivery

Daily wallpaper delivery from Bing (MS Edge new tab background) and Spotlight (Windows lock screen background).
Wallpapers are delivered using a GitHub action daily (configurable) to a Telegram channel.

Telegram bot token (`bot_token`) and channel (`chat_id`) are the parameters saved in the project's secrets and used to call the main function.

Inspired by [Spotlight-Downloader](https://github.com/ORelio/Spotlight-Downloader) and [spotlight](https://github.com/KoalaBR/spotlight).
